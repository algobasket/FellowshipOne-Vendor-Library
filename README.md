#FellowshipOne PHP Library

This is a small PHP library for interacting with the FellowshipOne API through V2V authentication.

Oauth requires you to authenicate as a specifc user in order to access various API methods. V2V does not have this limitation.  This allows you to make API calls by sending the authenication through the header and not tying the interaction to a specific user. 

You can find out more about the FellowshipOne API by going to [developer.fellowshipone.com](http://developer.fellowshipone.com)

##Acknowledgment 

I modified the code from Daniel Boorn's [FellowshipOne-API](https://github.com/deboorn/FellowshipOne-API/). His library utilizes the Oauth authentication method in F1.
